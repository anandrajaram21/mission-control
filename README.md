# Mission Control

Mission Control is an app that aims to revive the classroom during the time of online learning by increasing the interaction between students and teachers, using the concept of gamification. When students interact with teachers in class, either by asking questions, or by giving answers to questions, the teacher can reward the students with points. The student can then use these points to buy exciting rewards in the rewards shop, like extending assignment submissions beyond their due date, and many more.
